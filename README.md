Oystercard Challenge - Week 2
=============================

The challenge was to build a system to allow an oystercard to be used to travel between stations. This was split into the following requirements from the user stories:

  * check the card balance
  * add money to the balance
  * have a balance limit
  * deduct a fare from card balance
  * touch in/out capabilities
  * check minimum balance
  * pay for journey on completion
  * journey history
  * station zones
  * penalty charges

Learning topics included:

  * Reinforcing TDD
  * Introduction to Gemfiles
  * Struct & Openstruct
  * Class Extraction
  * Importance of SRP
  * Edge cases
  * Stroring and accessing information using arrays & hashes.

I worked with Yan-Yi Li, Frazer Watson, Godfrey Chiu and Rebecca Piper.
